            <p>I&rsquo;ve called Oklahoma City home for the last 8 years. I started here at Oklahoma Christian University in 2013, and I&rsquo;ve
grown an awful lot as a person while here.</p>
<p>During the summer of my junior year of college at OC, I had the opportunity to intern in DC, focusing on the ways
that engineering and technology can inform the public policy process. I grew in so many ways when I was in DC that summer.
I came out to my friends and some of my family, and I truly felt like I was in a place that <em>fit</em> for me. Which made it all
the more difficult to leave just a short 14 weeks later. DC felt magical to me in a way that is <em>still</em> hard for me to articulate.
To paraphrase author and conversion therapy survivor Julie Rodgers, DC feels like &ldquo;queer DisneyLand,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
<p>After I got back to Oklahoma that fall, I began my senior year and I somehow found a way to navigate being an out gay man at a Christian university, that had
historically been hostile to folks like me. I even came out at chapel that year, and gave a talk (that you can read here). I&rsquo;d like to believe that I had some impact on the trajectory of the conversation surrounding queer issues at Oklahoma Christian. I don&rsquo;t pretend that it is anything close to the steadfast faculty and staff that work to deter forces that would otherwise eliminate the few spaces on campus that are safe and affirming. When Tim Cook, CEO of Apple came out, he said, in closing, â€˜We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brickâ€™. I feel that this is a fitting quote for my contributions at OC, however small to that movement.</p>
<p>When I got that internship I joked with one of my
good friends, Aubrey that I should make a blog called &ldquo;Dispatches from the District&rdquo; where I chronicle my life living
in the District for the summer. While I bought the domain then, and have kept it since, I never actually did anything with it that summer.</p>
<p>I started my career here in 2017 at Paycom, before ultimately deciding to switch careers to civil service in the Air Force.
When I made that initial jump to the Air Force a lot of people thought I was crazy, I was giving up salary, some benefits, and
the opportunity to be a part of one of the greatest growth stories of any Oklahoma company in recent memory.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always believed you have to make decisions for yourself, your goals, and your future. I&rsquo;m lucky, I am someone who has
relatively little responsibility. A lot of people don&rsquo;t have the luxury of packing up their lives and moving across the country
without a significant amount of upheaval in the personal lives. I recognize that I am extraordinarily lucky in this way.</p>
<p>In December, I will embark on the next stage of my journey, working for Apple as a Systems Engineer. I&rsquo;m excited for the opportunity,</p>
<p>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/emojify/"><code>emojify</code></a> function can be called directly in templates or <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/#inline-shortcodes">Inline Shortcodes</a>.</p>
<p>To enable emoji globally, set <code>enableEmoji</code> to <code>true</code> in your siteâ€™s <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/">configuration</a> and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/">Emoji cheat sheet</a> is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.</p>

<p><strong>N.B.</strong> The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.</p>
